As a simple example, consider an attribute 'address'. In a relational database, either we define an address attribute as one atomic value of type string or it could be defined as a number of attributes (one each for street, city, country and postcode). In the latter case, writing queries would be more complicated, as each field would have to be mentioned. A better solution to either case is to allow structured data types - such as the type address with subparts street, city, country and postcode. Now an instance of type address can either be viewed as a whole or as individual subparts.

Typically, it is held as an attribute in a relational database which references to a file. Storing the data in external files is not a good way of manipulating this data: the DBMS has no knowledge of the structure of this data and cannot perform queries or operations on it.
