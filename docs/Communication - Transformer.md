## 1. Overview

Transformers transforms the previous xMessage from the user to one that needs to be sent next. It is essentially a microservice that based on the previous user action, returns a new xMessage that will then be shown to the user. This also enables conversion from one type

All inbound messages pass through a transformer. If a transformer is not assigned, then a null transformer is assigned to the xMessage. Since the current implementation of MessageRosa is only in Java, currently there is a limitation on the number of languages you can build the transformer on which right now is just Java.

Simply put a transformer looks something like this ![](https://samagra-development.github.io/docs/img/transformer.jpg)

### 1.1 Responsibilities

- Acts as a state machine and converts messages from one state to another.
- Used to transform messages
- Applies conversational logic (constraints or input format)

### 1.2 List of transformers

- Form transformer
- Menu transformer
- PDF transformer

## 2. Creating your own Transformer

All transformers are named as `<Action>Transformer`; for example PDFTransformer will create generate a PDF from the previous XMessage and convert it to an XMessage. Adapters should extend `TransformerProvider`. Thus, it needs to implement the following methods:

- ```java
    public XMessage transform(XMessage nextMsg) //Takes in XMessage and return the next message.
  ```

All transformers with the above implementation will be valid. An example adapter can be found [here]().

## 3. Properties of a transformer

- Transformers could call external services and wait for resposes from them to process message. These transformers are called `call-only` transformer. An example of this transformer is the PDF service transformer which calls the PDF service to check the status of queue of previous message and responds with a response containing PDF for the user.
- All transformers need to be registered. All unregistered transformers will not be acted upon. This is what essentially adds a topic to broker on which the messages are pushed. Also this requires some basic config of the max time a transformer could take to process the message.
- Scaling of transformers is done horizontally but the broker needs to know the number so tha partitions can be reconfigured.
- Since it's part of a state machine. If the transformer is stuck it needs communicate to the Orchestrator to that it can be escalate.
