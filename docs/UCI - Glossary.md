| S. No | Term | Definition |
| ----- | ---- | -----------|
| 1 | User | Any person or system that interacts with the bot. |
| 2 | UCI | Unified Communication Interface |
| 3 | Bot | A bot orchestrates a conversation with a specific conversation logic assigned to a set of users. A bot remembers the state of a conversation for a particular user. A bot object references user segment(s) and conversation logic(s). |
| 4 | Conversation |Any exchange of recorded messages between two parties (users or systems) is called a conversation. |
| 5 | Conversation Logic | Conversation logic defines the control flow for a specific conversation. A conversation logic object references a sequence of transformers that will be applied to arrive at the final response at a specific point in the conversation, and the associated adapter config for this conversation logic. (e.g. XForm logic, translation into Hindi - both associated with a Whatsapp-Gupshup adapter) |
| 6 | Communication Channel | Any application or channel that allows users to connect with each other to exchange information. Examples of communication channels include (but not limited to), WhatsApp, SMS, Email, Slack, IVRS, Telegram. |
| 7 | Conversation Data | All the data that is generated as a result of the communication on the bot. User input data as well as bot responses are called as conversation data. |
| 8 | Service Provider | Any public or private organization that provides the service of gathering the response from the Communication Application and transmits the same over standard APIâ€™s to this Unified Communications Interface. Examples of service providers include (but not limited to) Gupshup, Twillo, Infobip, Netcore. | 
| 9 | User Registry (Local, Federated) | A place (index, directory or registry) where users profile data is stored, this can be a local storage as part of the Communication bot or a federated storage at different databases. |
| 10 | Adapter | An adapter translates between messages received from communication channels on specific providers and the internal XMessage format. | A new adapter is created for every combination of communication channel and service provider (e.g. - WhatsApp + Gupshup; WhatsApp + NetCore; WhatsApp + Twilio). An adapter config references the communication channel, service provider and associated metadata such as specific business account phone number. |
| 11 | Transformer | A transformer is a stateless processing object that takes inputs and converts the input into a processed response. Transformers may in turn call external services if needed. For example - Open Data Kit (ODK) |
| 12 | Register a bot | An API that allows users to register for a new bot. |
| 12 | Remote Data Repositories | Any remote repositories (e.g. user db, content db or others) required in a conversation logic can be to be accessed . | 
| 13 | Standards | These are set of standards that are defined in this Unified Communication Interfaces. These standards are the guardians and helpers to ensure basic functioning and to some extent modularity. |
| 14 | Logs | All the inbound and outbound interactions that happen with the bot are captured and stored. |
| 15 | Admin Console | An application that is built to consume UCI APIs, to enable bot configuration and visualizations on top of UCI configuration and conversation data. |
| 16 | XMPP - XMessage | This is a standard defined for the UCI ecosystem. Key objective of this is to make the internal functioning UCI, independent of external factors viz. Communication channel and service provider. |
| 17 | XForms | XForms is an XML markup for a new generation of forms and form-like applications on the Web. |
| 18 | Role Based Access Control | Role-based access control or role-based security is an approach to restricting system access to authorized users. Amongst other functions this restricts bot usage only to a allowed group of users. |
